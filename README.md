## Description for the user how to use the RPA UIpath automation:  
- Launch RPA Tool: Open the RPA application installed on your computer.
- Load the Project: Access the project that contains the RPA script.
- Configure Input from Excel Folder: If the script requires input, specify the Excel folder containing the necessary data.
- Execute the Script: Locate and press the "Run" or "Start" button within the RPA tool. Initiate the script by clicking the designated button.
- Monitor the Process: Keep a close watch on the process as it unfolds. Pay attention to any error messages or pop-ups.
- Evaluate Results: After the script finishes, review the generated output and any associated reports.
- Exception Handling (if required): If errors arise, follow on-screen instructions or consult the logs.
- Save Generated Data (if applicable): Preserve any files or data produced by the script in the assigned location.
- Close the RPA Application:
- Conclude the process by closing the RPA tool upon script completion.
- Provide Feedback and Report: Share feedback, whether it be about issues encountered or successful execution, with the individual responsible for maintaining the script.
